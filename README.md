# Community site prototype

This is the framework.

Content is not included in this repo. It should go in a `content` directory in the root.

See the `content` directory of [`gridhub`](https://github.com/NickSto/galaxy-hub/tree/gridhub) branch of the `galaxy-hub` repo for how it should be laid out.
